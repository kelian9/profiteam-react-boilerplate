# Setup Editor

You can edit Profiteam React Boilerplate using any editor or IDE, but we use VS Code.

## VS Code

We provide a `.vscode` folder out-of-the-box which includes the **recommended extensions** and **settings**

We recommend these extensions for the best DX. Extensions are responsible for:

- [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

These are the basic building blocks in the boilerplate.

## Chrome Extensions

For a better debugging and development experience we suggest [Redux Developer Tools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?utm_source=ext_app_menu) and [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en). In the boilerplate, Redux is configured with this extension in mind so that you can debug and monitor your state changes very easily.
